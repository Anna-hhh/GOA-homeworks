  Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access, or where text can be revealed progressively at multiple levels of detail. Hypertext is an innovative way to link and access information of various kinds to form a web of information nodes the user can navigate at will.

  Hypertext is the underlying concept defining the structure of the World Wide Web. It enables the easy and quick navigation of information by clicking on hyperlinks, which are usually highlighted or underlined text.

  The term "hypertext" was coined by Ted Nelson in 1963. Hypertext systems, such as the World Wide Web, use hyperlinks to connect different pieces of information, allowing users to navigate from one document to another with ease.
